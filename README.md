# Security-Cam
Its a ML based mini project, but has strong fundamentals of optical physics and how its packages are used in this project
Kindly read the code and use it for references, if needed, but don't just copy and paste it, try to understand the syntax and algorithm of code
Remember coding is fun not hard, it's way how you see it
Coding in Machine Learning(ML) will give you strong knowledge how the AI works in many devices, Thank you
